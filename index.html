          <h3>Front End Development</h3>
          <p>
            During my education, I have gained many skills and worked with numerous tools for the web. I have made several websites static and dynamic as well. During this time, I achieved an excellent understanding of <strong>HTML5, CSS3, Javascript(ES6)</strong>, and I also experienced working with different libraries and frameworks such as <strong> React, Microsoft Razer Pages, Bootstrap, and jQuery</strong>.

          <h3>Mobile Development (React Native)</h3>
          <p>
            Last semester I have decided to learn Mobile Development, henceforth I managed the React Native framework and covered a large number of different topics. I was working on a Full-Stack project and followed the MERN Stack schema. I gained insight into <strong>Node.js and express.js </strong> backend framework, as well as,  I also experienced working with <strong>Mongo.DB</strong>. This project helped me to learn more and become a master of writing ES6 Javascript. Moreover, it gave me a good understanding of how React Native works, which influenced my project's development.

          <h3>Desktop Applications (Electron.js)</h3>
          <p>
            Since Javascript is a versatile language and I have worked on numerous desktop applications in the past I mastered creating desktop applications using Electron.js. I have an excellent knowledge of how a user-friendly user interface should look like and I can take care of the work on backend tasks(mentioned above Node.js, express.js, MongoDB) as well.
